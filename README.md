👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm a blockchain validator and developer, coding in Linux and multiple programming languages (Python, Rust, Go, and more). I specialize in process automation, information security, and building efficient blockchain systems.

🔐 Security is key in my work, so I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and methods to protect data. My Linux administration experience helps me build reliable and scalable solutions for various ecosystems.

⚙️ I focus on developing and optimizing processes to ensure smooth node operations. As a validator on Polkadot, I'm actively involved in supporting the network and troubleshooting issues.

📈 In my free time, I'm passionate about trading and exploring financial markets. It helps me think strategically and assess risks, both in code and investments.
